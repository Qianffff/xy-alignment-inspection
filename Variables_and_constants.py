# An alignment procedure is a sequence of scans that determine the mark position with increasing accuracy.
# For each step of the alignment procedure, define the frame_width (in m), pixel_width (in m), and desired SNR.
# The parameter 'frame_width' defined above should match the framewidth of the first step of the procedure.
